This directory contains the coding work that was needed to convert an image of stars into a list of coordinates (in pixels) of each star's x-position, y-position, and radius, which were then later used to create a hoverable image map that gave each star its own popup.

**sectorData:** Contains unprocessed pixel data for each of the 48 sectors of the original image, generated by executing imgToArray.py on each of the 48 sector images.

**algorithmAnnotated.js:** An annotated search-and-paint algorithm based off of the scanline fill algorithm, for capturing and grouping all of the contiguous white pixels in each star in a given data set.

**arrayToCoords.js:** An extended and non-annotated version of the algorithm above, for use in an Angular page built to display final coordinate data.

**imgToArray.py**: Script written by [Tanner Lake](https://github.com/tlake) for converting images into 2D pixel arrays of 0 (black) and 1 (white).

**numberCruncher.html:** Angular HTML page for taking in sector data, applying the arrayToCoords algorithm, and displaying final coordinate data.

**starCoords.js:** Text file containing the resulting data, organized by sector and star size and including the addition of manually-plotted stars.
